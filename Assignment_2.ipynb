    "# Definition: Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data too well, including the noise and specific details, instead of learning the underlying patterns. This leads to the model performing very well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "# Mitigation Techniques:\n",
    "# Regularization: This involves adding constraints to the model during training, penalizing overly complex models that try to fit every detail in the data. Common techniques include L1/L2 regularization and dropout.\n",
    "# Data Augmentation: Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by techniques like flipping images, adding noise, or paraphrasing text helps the model learn general patterns rather than specific features.\n",

    "# Might not be the best choice for all problems, especially if all features are important.\n",
    "# 2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concept: Adds the square of the model's coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "# Effect: Shrinks all coefficient values towards zero, but not necessarily to zero like L1. This enforces a smoother model by reducing the influence of large coefficients.\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "# Generally more stable than L1, performs well for a wider range of problems.\n",
    "# Less likely to completely eliminate features, maintaining some contribution from all features.\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "# Doesn't perform feature selection like L1.\n",
    "# 3. Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concept: Combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding a combination of the absolute value and square of the coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "# Effect: Provides a balance between L1 and L2, offering both feature selection and weight shrinkage.\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "# Can be useful when some features are irrelevant and you want to perform feature selection while also shrinking weights.\n",
    "# Offers more control over the regularization process compared to L1 or L2 alone.\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "# Requires tuning an additional hyperparameter (the weight between L1 and L2 penalties) to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "# 4. Dropout:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concept: This technique randomly drops out a certain percentage of neurons (units) in a neural network during training.\n",
    "# Effect: Prevents neurons from co-adapting too much and relying on each other. This encourages the network to learn more robust features and reduces overfitting.\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
